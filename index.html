            <p>Hi there! I am a poet and dancer who is learning to be a web developer. Most of my friends would describe me as an extrovert, and I love talking to people. I also enjoy cats, sunsets, beaches, and foreign travel.  My favorite celebrity is <a href="http://www.patrickstewart.org">Sir Patrick Stewart</a> and my favorite word is "kumquat." I am currently attending <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> and starting to learn to program. Check out my pages below!</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <div class="box2">
      <p>I have spent the past 13 years since graduating from college in 2008 working in childcare, both in child development centers, and as a nanny. I decided to change career paths when I eventually decided that childcare was no longer a field of interest to me. My eventual goal is to become a Field Engineer or Product Manager, but for now I'm learning basic programming and web development skills at Epicodus.</p>
      <p>I have a bit of a varied education history. I started high school in the United States, and finished my last year as an exchange student in Germany. I then attended a community college in my hometown (<span class="highlight">College of the Siskiyous</span>) for a year, and then transferred to to <span class="highlight">Lewis & Clark College</span> in Portland with the intention of majoring in International Affairs. I switched majors during my first year there and ended up with a BA in English. After graduating and working in the childcare industry for a couple of years, I went back to school to obtain my certificate in Early Childhood Education from <span class="highlight">Portland Community College</span>. And now I can add Epicodus to this list!</p>

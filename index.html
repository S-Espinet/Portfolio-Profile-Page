  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi there! I am a poet and dancer who is learning to be a web developer. Most of my friends would describe me as an extrovert, and I love talking to people. I also enjoy cats, sunsets, beaches, and foreign travel.  My favorite celebrity is <a href="http://www.patrickstewart.org">Sir Patrick Stewart</a> and my favorite word is "kumquat." I am currently attending <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> and starting to learn to program. Check out my pages below!</p>
